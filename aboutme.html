                    <p>In the fall of 2015, we had opportunity knocking on our door. It was a chance that we couldn't pass up. So we packed up our things and left Seattle for the Rockies.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Our lives have been busy with exploring Denver, and the surrounding areas, including the food scene which we are still on the look out for our favorite places. </p>
                    <p>My husband Som doesn't feature much on this site and that is his choice, not mine. He is anti social media and I still shove a camera in his face when I can.</p>
